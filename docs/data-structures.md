## Overview


Data structures are the various means by which information is stored, communicated and acted upon. Fundamentally
they are numerical representations of information stored in a standardized way such that the data can be 
interpreted by the computer and reconstructed for the user. This information can range from a single, one digit
number to an entire movie which can then be transferred and reconstructed to reform the original information.


In the case of computing, this occurs through a base two number system called binary. Consequentially, all
data that your computer stores and uses is represented by a one or a zero at the lowest level. Understanding
how computers interpret and store this information is crucial to advanced usage.


## Number Systems


Number syystems are the various means by which numbers are represented. In normal life,
the most commonly used number system is the base ten number system, also known as decimal. It contains
numbers zero through nine, meaning that the decimal system is comprised of ten total digits. While this
may be the most common number system, it is not the only number system, and theoretically you could have
a number system that contains five digits, one hundred digits or as many or few as you can create symbols
for. In the case of computation, however, there are four primary number systems used to store and process
data.


### Decimal


Decimal is the most common number system in daily life. As previously mentioned, it is comprised
of ten digits, including zero. The number system iterates up from zero until nine, and then when 
a number is needed that is larger than nine, a one is added at the beginning of the number and the
value carries over to the left. For each time the rightmost number is iterated past nine, the left
number is iterated by one until the left number hits nine, at which point the process continues 
into the hundreths place. This idea of values carrying over is critical to understanding how alternate
number systems work.


### Binary


Binary is the number system that digital data is inevitably transformed back into before it is
manipulated by the processor. It is the purest form of data in computing and it is critical to understand.
Binary, like Decimal, operates using the same system of carrying over. The difference is that instead of nine,
the number that causes value to carry over into the next spot is a one. This gives binary two usable digits,
zero and one, and whenever the value of the right digit is iterated past one, the one carries over into the left
place. This process, just like with decimal, continues as the length in digits of the number gets larger and 
larger.


### Hexadecimal


Hexadecimal is the second most popular number system in computing because of its use in representing bytes
(more on that later). Hexadecimal, or coloquially hex, contains more potential digits than decimal does, and
those non arabic numbers are represented by the letters A through F. As the rightmost number increases past
nine, it carries on into A, B, C, D, E and F, which are equal to ten through fifteen. After a value greater
than fifteen (or F) needs to be represented, a one is added to the left place and the rightmost digit is
reset to zero.
